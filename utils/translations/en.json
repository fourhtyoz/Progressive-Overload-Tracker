        "conceptContent": "- Gradual Increase in Stress: Continuously challenge the body beyond its current ability.\n- Adaptation: The body becomes stronger and more efficient in response to stress.\n- Plateaus: Without progressive overload, the body stops adapting, leading to stagnation.",

        "importanceContent": "- Prevents Plateaus: Avoids stagnation by continuously challenging the body.\n- Builds Strength and Muscle: Stimulates growth and increased strength.\n- Enhances Endurance: Improves cardiovascular and muscular endurance.\n- Boosts Motivation: Tracks progress toward fitness goals",

        "exampleContent": "Scenario: You want to increase your squat strength.\n- Week 1: Squat 50 kg for 3 sets of 10 reps.\n- Week 2: Squat 52.5 kg for 3 sets of 10 reps.\n- Week 3: Squat 55 kg for 3 sets of 8 reps.\n- Week 4: Add an additional set or reduce rest time between sets.",
        "tipsTitle": "Tips for Effective Progressive Overload",
        "tipsContent": "- Start Slow: Avoid drastic increases to prevent injury or overtraining.\n- Track Progress: Use a workout journal or app to monitor weights, reps, and sets.\n- Focus on Recovery: Proper rest, nutrition, and sleep are essential for adaptation.\n- Be Consistent: Gradual, consistent effort is more sustainable than quick, drastic changes.\n- Listen to Your Body: Avoid overloading too quickly, which can lead to fatigue or injury"
